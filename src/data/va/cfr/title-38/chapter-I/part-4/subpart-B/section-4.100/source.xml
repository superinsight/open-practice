<HEAD>รยง 4.100 Application of the evaluation criteria for diagnostic codes 7000-7007, 7011, and 7015-7020.</HEAD>
<P>(a) Whether or not cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation (documented by electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, or X-ray) is present and whether or not there is a need for continuous medication must be ascertained in all cases.</P>
<P>(b) Even if the requirement for a 10% (based on the need for continuous medication) or 30% (based on the presence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation) evaluation is met, METs testing is required in all cases except:</P>
<P>(1) When there is a medical contraindication.</P>
<P>(2) When the left ventricular ejection fraction has been measured and is 50% or less.</P>
<P>(3) When chronic congestive heart failure is present or there has been more than one episode of congestive heart failure within the past year.</P>
<P>(4) When a 100% evaluation can be assigned on another basis.</P>
<P>(c) If left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) testing is not of record, evaluate based on the alternative criteria unless the examiner states that the LVEF test is needed in a particular case because the available medical information does not sufficiently reflect the severity of the veteran's cardiovascular disability.</P>
