<HEAD>Â§ 4.71 Measurement of ankylosis and joint motion.</HEAD>
<P>Plates I and II provide a standardized description of ankylosis and joint motion measurement. The anatomical position is considered as 0Â°, with two major exceptions: (a) Shoulder rotationâarm abducted to 90Â°, elbow flexed to 90Â° with the position of the forearm reflecting the midpoint 0Â° between internal and external rotation of the shoulder; and (b) supination and pronationâthe arm next to the body, elbow flexed to 90Â°, and the forearm in midposition 0Â° between supination and pronation. Motion of the thumb and fingers should be described by appropriate reference to the joints (See Plate III) whose movement is limited, with a statement as to how near, in centimeters, the tip of the thumb can approximate the fingers, or how near the tips of the fingers can approximate the proximal transverse crease of palm.</P>
